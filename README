What is Joobet2Symfony?
-----------------------

Jobbet2Symfony is the well known day by day tutorial for symfony 1.4 implemented on Symfony2.

to try it out, build your database (MySql) (update config.yml)

php app/console doctrine:database:create
php app/console doctrine:generate:entities
php app/console doctrine:generate:schema

Make sure the web folder is document root and visit the site:

http://jobbet2/app_dev.php
	or
http://localhost/web/app_dev.php

The home page doesn't exist yet so to try application:

http://jobbet2/app_dev.php/jobbet2.html

MAKE SURE YOUR PHP HAS THE intl EXTENSION if you get errors
about a missing Locale class. For instance, for MacPorts:

port install php5-intl


I'm working on it a bit day by day, any contribution will be very welcome.
Hope it will be helpfull!
